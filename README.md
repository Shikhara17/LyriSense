# LyriSense

## Introduction
**LyriSense** is a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) project designed to decode emotional and thematic patterns in song lyrics. Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques like BERT tokenization and TensorFlow's distributed training strategies, LyriSense classifies lyrics into specific themes, such as Sadness or Romance, providing data-driven insights for diverse applications.

## Key Features
- **Advanced NLP and ML Integration**: Uses BERT for tokenization and TensorFlow for implementing distributed training to accurately classify and analyze lyrical content.
- **Emotional and Thematic Analysis**: Capable of identifying a range of emotions and themes within lyrics, enhancing the understanding of musical content.
- **Versatile Application**: Ideal for use in music streaming services, cultural studies, and other areas requiring detailed lyrical analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow**: For scalable and efficient ML model training.
- **BERT**: Leveraged for its powerful NLP capabilities in tokenizing text.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development and scripting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for model development, training, and visualization.
